## Auto-Clicker-Eclipse-Turbo-Tap

[Try AUTO CLICK like a HUMAN!](https://github.com/yandeyka/Auto-Clicker-Eclipse-Turbo-Tap)

## Project Info

This auto-clicker simulates human-like clicking behavior with random timing and pause functionality. It also includes features for easily turning the auto-clicker on and off.

## Key Features:

* **Easy On/Off:** Toggle auto-clicking using F6 (ON) and F7 (OFF) keys.
* **Randomized Clicking:**  Clicks are spaced randomly to mimic human actions.  This helps avoid detection by anti-automation systems.
* **Pause Functionality:**  Includes a pause feature to temporarily stop auto-clicking.
